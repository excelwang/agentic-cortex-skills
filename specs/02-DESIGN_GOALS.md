# 02 - Design Goals

## 1. Project Mission
Create the most stable, protocol-driven, and "Source of Truth" centric AI coding assistant framework.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Separation of Powers**: Architect, Executor, Judge.
- **Protocol over Prompt**: Use scripts for deterministic state management.
- **Spec is Law**: All implementation must derive from a written specification.

## 3. Success Metrics
- Zero hallucination in state transitions.
- All code changes are verified against specs.
- Context is isolated and ephemeral.
