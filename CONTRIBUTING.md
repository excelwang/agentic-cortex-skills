# Contributing to Agentic Cortex Skills

We welcome contributions to the Agentic Cortex Skill Library!

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repository**.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix.
3.  **Add or Modify Skills**:
    - All skills reside in the `skills/` directory.
    - Each skill must have a `SKILL.md` with proper metadata (YAML frontmatter).
    - Use the `references/` directory within the skill for templates.
4.  **Verify**: Ensure your skill instructions are generic and reusable (avoid hardcoding project-specific paths).
5.  **Submit a Pull Request**.

## Skill Structure Violation

Do NOT create skills outside of the `skills/` directory.

## Style Guide

- Use clear, action-oriented language.
- Define specific "Personas" for your skills.
- Keep the `SKILL.md` concise.
